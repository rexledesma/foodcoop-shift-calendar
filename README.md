# PSFC Shift Calendar for Google Calendar

Instead of searching the Park Slope Food Coop (PSFC) [ðŸ“… Shift Calendar](https://members.foodcoop.com/services/shifts/) to sign up for a shift, you can now just search in your favorite calendar app. As featured on the [`@foodcoop` Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18038560394618051/)!

The calendar is available in the following formats:

- [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=9b8f99f4caf33d2afbd17ac5f64a5113c7e373686247a7126b6a0b96a8cbd462@group.calendar.google.com)
- [iCal](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/9b8f99f4caf33d2afbd17ac5f64a5113c7e373686247a7126b6a0b96a8cbd462%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

This works by scraping the PSFC Shift Calendar every 5 minutes, reconciling with a public calendar.
